# Session Handoffs

## Session 1: 3D Face Model Implementation (June 18, 2025)
**Developer**: Claude (guided by Jaewoo Kang)

### Accomplished in This Session:
1. **Replaced 2D SVG Face Model with 3D GLB Model**
   - Integrated Three.js and React Three Fiber for 3D rendering
   - Successfully loaded `face_model_zones copy.glb` file
   - Maintained all existing facial zone functionality
   - Added WebGL detection with graceful fallback

2. **Implemented Interactive Zone System**
   - Created overlay spheres for facial zones (temporary solution)
   - Added hover effects and click interactions
   - Preserved all area information (concerns, ingredients)
   - Implemented smooth animations and visual feedback

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Lazy loading with React Suspense
   - Optimized lighting setup for face visualization
   - Restricted camera controls for better UX
   - Added auto-rotation when no zone is active

4. **Mobile & Accessibility**
   - Touch-friendly controls for mobile devices
   - Separate instructions for desktop/mobile users
   - Fallback UI for browsers without WebGL support
   - Maintained keyboard navigation capability

5. **Technical Updates**
   - Installed dependencies: three@0.169.0, @react-three/fiber@8.16.8, @react-three/drei@9.105.6
   - Added fade-in animation to Tailwind config
   - Updated FaceModel.tsx with complete 3D implementation

### Next Session Requirements:

#### Priority 1: Update 3D Model with Clickable Meshes
**Current State**: Using overlay spheres as interactive zones (temporary solution)
**Required Update**: 
- Modify the GLB model to have separate, named meshes for each facial zone
- Each mesh should correspond to: forehead, eyes, cheeks, nose, lips, chin
- Remove overlay sphere system and use direct mesh interaction
- Implement raycasting on actual face geometry for precise zone detection

**Technical Approach**:
1. Open `face_model_zones copy.glb` in Blender or similar 3D software
2. Create/separate meshes for each facial zone
3. Name meshes consistently (e.g., "zone_forehead", "zone_eyes", etc.)
4. Export updated GLB with proper mesh hierarchy
5. Update FaceModel.tsx to detect clicks on named meshes instead of overlay spheres

#### Priority 2: Zone Position Refinement
- Fine-tune zone boundaries based on actual face geometry
- Ensure zones don't overlap and cover appropriate areas
- Add visual indicators for zone boundaries when hovered

#### Priority 3: Enhanced Interactions
- Link ingredient recommendations to ingredient database search
- Add transition animations between zone selections
- Implement zone-specific color overlays on the actual face mesh
- Add pulse effect for recommended zones based on user's skin concerns

### Code Areas Requiring Attention:
1. `FaceModel.tsx` lines 71-85: Replace `InteractiveZone` spheres with mesh detection
2. Zone mapping object (lines 8-15): Update with mesh names instead of positions
3. Consider adding a mesh outline shader for better zone visibility

### Dependencies to Consider:
- Possible addition of `@react-three/postprocessing` for outline effects
- May need `three-mesh-bvh` for optimized raycasting on complex geometry

### Testing Checklist for Next Session:
- [ ] Verify all zones are clickable on the actual face mesh
- [ ] Test performance on mobile devices (maintain 60fps)
- [ ] Ensure accessibility features still work
- [ ] Validate zone boundaries are anatomically accurate
- [ ] Check loading performance with updated GLB file
